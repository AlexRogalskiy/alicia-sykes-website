# The Homepage for Alicia Sykes

Live app: [https://aliciasykes.com](https://aliciasykes.com)

This is the source code for my personal homepage. It's nothing special, but thought I'd make the code open-source, on the off-chance that any of the components were any use to anyone else.

## Running Locally

- **Grab the source code** `git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/alicia-sykes-website.git`
- **Fetch dependencies** `yarn install`
- **Compile (with hot-reload!) for development** `yarn dev`
- **Compile and minify ready for production** `yarn build`
- **Start production server** `yarn start`
- **Run the tests** `yarn test`
- **Lints and auto-fixes files** `yarn lint`
- **Run the end-to-end tests** `yarn test:e2e`
